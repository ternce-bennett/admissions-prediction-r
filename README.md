This project uses logistic regression to predict graduate admissions outcomes based on applicant data, including GPA, GRE scores, work experience, research experience, and programming skills. The goal is to demonstrate core data analysis and statistical modeling skills relevant to a Masterâ€™s program in Statistics and Data Science.

The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features and admission decisions, followed by building and evaluating a logistic regression model to classify applicants as admitted or rejected. Model performance is assessed using accuracy and a confusion matrix, illustrating the predictive ability of the selected features.

This project reflects practical application of statistical methods and data science principles to real-world decision-making problems.
